# Description
My dotfiles just in case I will ever need to reinstall my os.  It's extremely messy and it's not anything special as I don't really tweak everything in every way possible. This repo is mainly for my own usage, but I guess someone might find this useful so I will leave it as a public repository.
I will try to keep this repo updated.
