# Description
My dotfiles just in case I will ever need to reinstall my os.  It's extremely messy and it's not anything special as I'm too lazy to tweak everything to its limits. This repo is mainly for my own usage, but I guess someone might find this useful so I will leave it as a public repository.
I will try to keep this repo updated.
